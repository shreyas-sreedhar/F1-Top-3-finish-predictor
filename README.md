# F1 Top 3 Finish Predictor

This repository contains a Streamlit application designed to predict whether a Formula 1 driver will finish in the top 3 based on the driver, car team, and specific Grand Prix event. The model leverages historical F1 race data to make these predictions.

## Project Overview

The F1 Top 3 Finish Predictor is built using a RandomForest classifier trained on historical data from F1 races. It considers various features such as the driver's identity, car team, race track, and the number of laps completed to predict top 3 finishes.

## Features

- **Prediction Interface**: Users can select a driver, car team, and Grand Prix event and specify the number of laps completed to receive predictions about finishing in the top 3.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Includes 3D scatter plots and bar charts to explore the relationship between drivers, car teams, and Grand Prix results.
- **Data Insights**: The application provides statistical distributions of race outcomes across drivers and teams, offering insights into patterns and performance trends in Formula 1 racing.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Plotly

## Setup and Installation

To run this application locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ``
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/F1-Top-3-Finish-Predictor.git
   cd F1-Top-3-Finish-Predictor
   ``
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ``
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``
3. Run the Streamlit application:
``streamlit run app.py``

## Model Training
To retrain the model or understand the training process, refer to the train_and_save.py script. This script processes the dataset, trains the RandomForest model, and saves it along with necessary label encoders.
